#  ðŸ’¬Babble: An Open Chat Application for iOS

This is a simple firebase based Chat application in which users can create an account and chat with all the users that are presently registered on the application.

Babble according to [Dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com) means:
talk rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way.
e.g. "they babbled on about their holiday"

I would appreciate it if you add a feature or two in this project.
